# Whack a mole

This little JavaScript game randomly displays "moles" in the form of small alien creatures.

The aim is simple: click on these "moles" as long as they are present, to collect points.
Some are worth more points than others.

Improvements are possible, to make the game more complex, speed it up over time, or allow a game over, for example.
